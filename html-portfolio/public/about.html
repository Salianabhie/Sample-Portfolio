<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Prasham Karkera, a novice programmer. I always had a curiosity to know and understand how do the computers work. As child I was fascinated by computers. It was the next cool things after the existence of cars. Now I have more interested in Aritifical Intelligence and the concepts behind them.</p>

<p>In this new evolving world, exciting new fields are opening. AI is rapidly growing and integrating in every part of humans lives. I am keen to understand how they think, communicate and grow. AI has a massive impact on our lifestyles. With the introduction of GPTS our codes can debugged faster. Developers rely on AI as tool to solve the problems they face during development. GTPS provide a way out when they are middled in errors.</p>
